Objective
As the data analyst of a company, you are presented with the airfare data covering the top 1,000 contiguous state city-pair markets. Help them analyze this data and identify trends.

Project Tasks

You can download the data you’ll be using for this specific project using the .csv file or the airfare_db.db.

I have analysed data based on the following questions

1) What range of years are represented in the data?
2) What are the shortest and longest-distanced flights, and between which 2 cities are they?
3) How many distinct cities are represented in the data (regardless of whether it is the source or destination)?
4) Which airline appear most frequently as the carrier with the lowest fare (ie. carrier_low)? How about the airline with the largest market share (ie. carrier_lg)?
5) How many instances are there where the carrier with the largest market share is not the carrier with the lowest fare? What is the average difference in fare?
