# Airfare Data

#### Objective
As the data analyst of a company, you are presented with the airfare data covering the top 1,000 contiguous state city-pair markets. Help them analyze this data and identify trends.

#### Project Tasks

You can download the data youâ€™ll be using for this specific project using the .csv file or the airfare_db.db.

I have analysed data based on the following questions

- What range of years are represented in the data?
- What are the shortest and longest-distanced flights, and between which 2 cities are they?
- How many distinct cities are represented in the data (regardless of whether it is the source or destination)?
- Which airline appear most frequently as the carrier with the lowest fare (ie. carrier_low)? How about the airline with the largest market share (ie. carrier_lg)?
- How many instances are there where the carrier with the largest market share is not the carrier with the lowest fare? What is the average difference in fare?
